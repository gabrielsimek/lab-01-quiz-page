## Making a plan
1) Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"
2) Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision
3) For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?
    - This is your pseudocode
4) Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
5) Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events.
6) Think about how to validate each of your steps

Create a quiz based on content i have provided in the html

the content should be three sections

there should be a button to start the quiz

a section in which to display the results of the quiz

elements that will be manipultated (button, results section) should be imported
Create a eventListener that triggers the quiz

The quiz (JS)
ask for usersname (promt)
    store as variable

Ask if user wants to take quiz (confirm)

Ask three questions (promt)
    create function to confrim if it was a yes
        if statement, if first letter of word is Y then true
    store the results of the quiz(variable)
    increment for each correct answer (score++)

Alert the user that the quiz has been completed (alert)

push the results of the quiz to the results section and use '${}'

change contents and style of result based on user score
    if score >= 0 style.backgroundcolor = red
    if score >=
    etc...
    should be
